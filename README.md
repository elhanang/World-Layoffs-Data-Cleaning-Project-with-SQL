**Project Title** 

World Layoffs Data Cleaning with SQL

**Project Overview**

This project contains data of layoffs from around the world from when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic - 11th March, 2020 to 6th March, 2023, particularly from tech companies. The project involves cleaning the data and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find better insights and to explore the data to find trends and patterns.

**Source of Data**

The data was obtained from Layoffs Dataset from around the world for a period of three years (2020-2023) on Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022].

**Tools**

The tool used for this project was MySQL. This was used for both the data cleaning and EDA process.

**Data Cleaning Process**

The data was gotten into a more usable format. A lot of issues in the raw data were fixed to prevent running into issues when creating things like visualizations or in the EDA process. The cleaning process involved four steps, namely:
1.	Checking for and removing duplicates.
2.	Standardizing the data and fixing any errors. If there were issues with spellings or date formats, the data was standardized so it be more usable.
3.	Looking at null or blank values to see if they could be populated or not.
4.	Removing any columns or rows that weren’t needed.

**Usage**

To run the SQL code:
•	Open MySQL.
•	Connect to the database containing the layoffs Dataset.
•	Copy and execute the SQL queries sequentially.
